# Bulk Email Sender with Attachment Support (GUI-Based)

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for sending bulk emails using a template and recipient list from an Excel file. It allows the user to:

* Log in with an email account (supports Office365 SMTP).
* Select an HTML email template.
* Select an Excel file with recipient email addresses.
* Optionally attach a file.
* Review the selected files and email subject before sending.
* Send personalized emails to all recipients listed in the Excel file.

Each email is sent with the same subject and body, and optionally includes an attachment.

## âœ… Input File Format

### ðŸ“„ Excel File (`.xlsx`)

The Excel file must have the email addresses listed in **column A**, one per row. Example:

| Email Address                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| [user1@example.com](mailto:user1@example.com) |
| [user2@example.com](mailto:user2@example.com) |
| ...                                           |

### ðŸ“„ HTML Template

Any valid `.html` or `.htm` file. This will be used as the body of the email.
You can create and save an email into a `.html` or `.htm` file and use that for the template.
